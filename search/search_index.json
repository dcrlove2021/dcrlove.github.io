To account for variance in the price of DCR, amounts must be specified in USD. The amount of DCR distributed will then be adjusted at payout according to the exchange rate.</li> <li>Duration of contract: If your proposal provides an ongoing service, your proposal must provide an end date.</li> <li>Restrictions on deliverables: Specify any license or other restrictions on deliverables. For example, if delivering software, specify whether it will be open-source, closed-source, and what (if any) license will be used.</li> <li>Reporting commitment: Specify how you plan to report on the progress of your project.
